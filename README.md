# Excel 3rd axis plot
I professionally work with heat and electricity data and I have struggled with presenting different types of data on one chart (especcialy water flow, temperature and heat at once). 

This is one possible solution for the problem. <br/>
Notes:
1. Colors of y-axis labels corresponds with series' colours.
2. You can change primary y-axis limits in traditional way, but simultaneously you have to change values in AJ27 i AJ28 cells.
3. You can change third y-axis limits with ScrollBars.
4. Additionally you can change number of third y-axis labels with SpinButton.
